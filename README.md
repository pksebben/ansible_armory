# Ansible Armory

This is a set of ansible playbooks to set up various tools useful to a particular dev environment (that is, my dev environment).  I provide them here in case I need them, and make them public in case anyone else wishes to use them.

Each one comes with instructions in comments at the top of the file.  If there are problems, feel free to reach out - I will take a look when time and space allow.
